This results in that facility appearing twice. The identified Joint Venture participants have each included the same data for the Callide C Power Station in their NGER reports. This is because nomination of operational control has not been made, as neither participant had the greatest ability to introduce and implement the operating and environmental policies in relation to the facility.
